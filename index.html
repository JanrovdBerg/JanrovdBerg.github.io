<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Hello! I'm <b>Janro van der Berg</b>, a <b>Mechanical Engineer</b> with experience in <b>Semiconductor Lithography Equipment</b>.<br>
I was born and raised in <b>Nelspruit, South Africa</b>, where I developed a strong work ethic and a passion for problem-solving.<br><br>

Growing up in a boys' hostel, I quickly learned the importance of <b>discipline and responsibility</b>.<br>
I also had the privilege of spending time on my family’s farms, which became my favorite place to be.<br>
Life on the farm taught me <b>practical skills, resilience, and the value of maintaining what you build</b>—as we say in South Africa: <i>"A farmer always makes a plan."</i><br><br>

Realizing my love for <b>solving complex challenges</b>, I pursued a degree in <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> at <b>North-West University</b> in Potchefstroom.<br>
After graduating, I joined a small but <b>highly skilled engineering team</b> designing and manufacturing <b>Chlorine Dioxide Generators for water purification</b>.<br>
In this role, I gained <b>hands-on experience in product design, procurement, logistics, maintenance, and scaling production</b>.<br>
I also contributed to the design of an improved water-cleaning process.<br><br>

Wanting to <b>expand my knowledge and push my limits</b>, I moved to the Netherlands and joined <b>ASML</b> as a <b>System Performance Engineer</b>.<br>
This role constantly challenges me with new problems to solve, and I love every moment of it.<br>
I’m passionate about <b>continuous learning, innovation, and making systems work efficiently.</b><br>
</p>

<h2>Skills & Experience</h2>
<p>
Despite being a <b>young professional</b>, I have worked in a <b>wide variety of roles</b>, including:<br><br>

✔ <b>System Performance Engineer</b> (Semiconductor Industry)<br>
✔ <b>Mechanical Engineer</b> (Water Purification Systems)<br>
✔ <b>Design Engineer</b> (Product Development)<br>
✔ <b>Retail Floor Manager</b> (Leadership & Sales)<br>
✔ <b>Farm Technician</b> (Hands-on Maintenance & Problem-Solving)<br>
✔ <b>Construction Worker</b> (Teamwork & Precision)<br>
✔ <b>Bartender</b> (Fast-Paced Work & Communication)<br><br>

While <b>System Performance Engineering</b> has been my primary focus for the past <b>two years</b>,<br>
my <b>diverse background</b> has given me a <b>broad skill set</b> that makes me adaptable and resourceful.<br><br>

Some of the key skills I bring to the table include:<br><br>

- <b>Problem-Solving & Troubleshooting</b> – Quickly diagnosing and fixing issues in complex systems.<br>
- <b>Strong Communication</b> – Explaining technical concepts to both engineers and non-technical stakeholders.<br>
